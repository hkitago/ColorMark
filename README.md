# <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hkitago/ColorMark/refs/heads/main/Shared%20(App)/Resources/Icon.png" height="36" valign="bottom"/> ColorMark for Safari Extension

This Safari extension lets you highlight any text on web pages using various colors with your device's standard color picker. It's easy to mark important content and share direct links to your highlighted sections for quick reference. Your highlights will stay saved until you remove them manually or the webpage content changes, so they're always ready when you return. With modern sharing capabilities, highlighting and sharing text has never been easier, helping others quickly find and understand key information.

Perfect for educators, students, researchers, and presenters working with web content. Whether you're preparing study materials, sharing research findings, or creating engaging presentations, this extension helps you organize and share your ideas clearly and effectively.

## Installation & Uninstallation

### Installation

To install the extension on iOS or iPadOS, go to Settings > Apps > Safari > Extensions, or enable the extension by toggling it on in the Manage Extensions option found in the Safari address bar.
For macOS, open Safari, go to Safari > Settings > Extensions, and enable the extension from there.

### Uninstallation

To uninstall the extension, similarly to the installation process, toggle the extension off, or remove it completely by selecting the extension icon on the Home Screen and choosing "Delete app".

## Usage

1. Load a web page. It is recommended to use the webpage with a stable and permanent URL. Dynamic pages or frequently changing content may affect the functionality of text fragments and may prevent highlights from being restored upon revisiting the page.
2. Select the text on the web page.
3. Tap the icon next to the address bar and choose the extension. On macOS, you can also use the "ColorMark" command from the context menu.
4. A window will slide up from the bottom on iPhone, while a pop-up window will appear on iPad and Mac. You can change the default highlight color, remove highlighted items, modify their colors, or share them using the Text Fragment API with the Share Sheet API. *For reference, the highlighted items appear in the same order as the text within the web page.*
